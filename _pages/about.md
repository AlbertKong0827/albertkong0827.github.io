Hi, I’m Linghang Kong — data scientist by day, poker strategist by night, and part-time philosopher of the metaphysical arts.

By profession, I build AI systems that (mostly) behave. By passion, I enjoy reading people at the poker table and decoding the universe through Ba Zi and Feng Shui — because sometimes, predicting the markets isn’t that different from interpreting your birth chart under a metal dragon year.

I like clean code, bold ideas, and well-aligned qi.
Welcome to my corner of the internet — where logic meets intuition, and models meet metaphors.
